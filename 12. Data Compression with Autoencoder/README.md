The provided code demonstrates the implementation of an autoencoder using the Keras library for data compression. Here's a description of each step in the code:

1. Import the required libraries from Keras.
2. Define the dimensions of the input and the encoding layer. `input_dim` represents the dimensionality of the input data, and `encoding_dim` represents the desired dimensionality of the encoded representation.
3. Create a sequential model to build the autoencoder.
4. Add a dense layer to the autoencoder model as the encoder layer. The encoder layer reduces the dimensionality of the input data and applies the activation function 'relu' to introduce non-linearity.
5. Add another dense layer to the autoencoder model as the decoder layer. The decoder layer aims to reconstruct the original input data and uses the 'sigmoid' activation function to squash the output values between 0 and 1.
6. Compile the autoencoder model using the 'adam' optimizer and the 'binary_crossentropy' loss function, which is commonly used for binary classification problems.
7. Load and preprocess the data. In this example, a random dataset `X` is generated with shape (1000, input_dim), where `input_dim` is the dimensionality of the input data. Replace this line with your actual data.
8. Train the autoencoder by fitting it to the input data `X` for a specified number of epochs (50 in this case) and with a batch size of 32.
9. Create a separate encoder model to extract the compressed representation of the data. This model includes only the encoder layer from the trained autoencoder.
10. Use the encoder model to compress the data by calling the `predict` method on the encoder with the input data `X`.
11. Print the shapes of the original data `X` and the compressed data `compressed_data` to observe the dimensionality reduction achieved.

By using an autoencoder, the code aims to compress the input data `X` by reducing its dimensionality through an encoder layer. The compressed data can be further utilized for various purposes, such as feature extraction, data visualization, or downstream tasks like classification or clustering.
