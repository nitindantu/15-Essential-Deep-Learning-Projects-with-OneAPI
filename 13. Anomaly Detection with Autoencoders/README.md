In this example, we load the credit card fraud dataset into a pandas DataFrame. The dataset contains features related to credit card transactions and a binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

We split the data into training and testing sets and normalize the input features using z-score normalization.

The autoencoder is defined with an input layer, an encoding layer, and a decoding layer. The encoding layer has a lower dimension than the input layer, allowing the autoencoder to learn a compressed representation of the input data.

The autoencoder is compiled with an optimizer and a loss function. We train the autoencoder using the training data and validate it on the testing data.

After training, we use the trained autoencoder to reconstruct the input data and calculate the reconstruction loss (mean squared error) between the input and reconstructed data.

We define a threshold for classifying anomalies based on the reconstruction loss. Data points with a reconstruction loss above the threshold are classified as anomalies, while those below the threshold are classified as normal.

Finally, we evaluate the performance of the model by calculating the accuracy of the anomaly detection.

Note: It's important to note that the choice of threshold and evaluation metric may vary depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the credit card fraud detection task.
