Solving the XOR problem with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) involves training a neural network to accurately classify the XOR operation's inputs and outputs. The XOR problem is considered a non-linearly separable problem, making it challenging for simple linear models. An MLP, with its ability to model complex relationships, is well-suited for this task. The MLP architecture typically consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers with nonlinear activation functions (e.g., sigmoid or ReLU), and an output layer with an appropriate activation function (e.g., sigmoid or softmax). By training the MLP on labeled XOR data, adjusting the weights and biases through backpropagation and gradient descent, the network can learn to approximate the XOR function. With proper training, the MLP should be able to accurately predict the XOR outputs for any given input combination, effectively solving the XOR problem.
