The provided code demonstrates the implementation of an LSTM-based model for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. The goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on the text content.

The code first loads the IMDB dataset using the `imdb.load_data` function, limiting the vocabulary size to the top 5000 most frequent words and setting a maximum sequence length of 100 words for each review. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets.

Next, the code builds an LSTM model using the Keras library. The model consists of an embedding layer that maps the input words to dense vectors of fixed size, followed by an LSTM layer with 128 units to capture the sequence information. Finally, a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function is added to produce the binary classification output.

The model is compiled with the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. It is then trained on the training data using a batch size of 32 and for 5 epochs. The validation data is used to monitor the model's performance during training.

After training, the model is evaluated on the test data using the `evaluate` function, which computes the loss and accuracy metrics. The results are printed, showing the test loss and accuracy achieved by the model.

In summary, this code demonstrates how to train an LSTM model for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset, allowing for the classification of movie reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content.
