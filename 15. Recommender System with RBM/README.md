In this example, we load the MovieLens 1M dataset, specifically the ratings data from the ratings.dat file. We normalize the ratings between 0 and 1 by dividing them by 5.0.

Next, we create a user-movie matrix where each row represents a user and each column represents a movie. We fill in the matrix with the normalized ratings.

Then, we define the RBM model with the desired parameters, such as the number of components (hidden units), number of iterations, and learning rate.

We train the RBM model using the user-movie matrix.

Finally, we can generate recommendations for a specific user by feeding the user's ratings into the RBM and obtaining the reconstructed ratings. We sort the reconstructed ratings to get the top recommended movies.
